1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
0 a relative letdown . 
0 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
1 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
0 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
0 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
0 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
0 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
0 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
0 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
0 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
0 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
1 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . 
1 oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
0 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
0 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
0 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
0 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
1 it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
0 cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
1 throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
0 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
0 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
0 there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
0 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
0 with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
0 mildly entertaining . 
1 it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . 
0 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
0 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
0 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
0 chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
0 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
1 there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
0 it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
1 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
1 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic .

0 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
1 an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
0 [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
0 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
0 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
0 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken .

0 any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
0 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
0 it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
0 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .

1 [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 
0 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
0 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
0 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .

1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
1 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
1 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
0 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .

0 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 .

0 a half-assed film . 
1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
0 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut .

0 bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
0 it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
1 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
0 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .

1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
1 by turns very dark and very funny .

0 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
0 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
0 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
0 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?

1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity .

0 schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
0 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
0 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation . 
0 a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
0 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .

1 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
0 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
1 denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
1 a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level .

1 creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
0 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
0 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
0 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
1 it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
0 the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
0 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .

0 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .

1 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication .

1  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
0 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
1 the performances are remarkable . 
0 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .

0 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
0 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
0 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
1 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .

0 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
1 it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
0 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
0 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .

0 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .

0 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
0 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
1 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
1 a potent allegorical love story .

1 a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
0 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

0 no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
0  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
0  " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
0 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .

1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
0 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .

0 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice .

0 demands too much of most viewers . 
1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
0 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
0 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .

1 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
1 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest . 
1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before .
